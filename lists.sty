% LISTS.STY - Various useful list macros

% From Mert Cramer: (paraphrased)
% I wanted an environment like the description environment (LaTeX book
% page 26-27) but with constant width tags, rather than a set indentation
% and various over- and under-lapping of the labels.
% Leslie Lamport provided this over the phone after a little prodding for
% use as in
%   \begin{describe}{Biggest Flag}
%     \item[flag] Blah blah ........
%   \end{describe}
%
% You may want to increase the separation between paragraphs (list items)
% by putting the command
%   \parskip=1.0ex
% after the \begin.  This will set the separation to the height of an x.

\def\describe#1{\list{}{\settowidth{\labelwidth}{#1}\leftmargin\labelwidth
\addtolength{\leftmargin}{\labelsep}
\def\makelabel##1{##1\hfill}}}\let\enddescribe\endlist

% The following is similar to describe above, but formats the flag in
% \item[flag] in a parbox, so you may use \\ inside flag.  Furthermore,
% the resulting box extends downwards (is sunk), adjacent to the describing
% text, e.g.
%
%    \item[flag\\falg] Blah blah .... .... blah blah
%
% will produce
%
%    flag    Blah blah ....
%    falg    .... blah blah
%
\def\sunklist#1{\list{}{\settowidth{\labelwidth}{#1}\leftmargin\labelwidth
\addtolength{\leftmargin}{\labelsep}
\def\makelabel##1{%
{\raisebox{0pt}[0pt][0pt]{\parbox[t]{\labelwidth}{##1}}\hfill}}}}%
\let\endsunklist\endlist

% Hanging tags for Description environments
% I wanted to make a list that looked like
%   item label
%     text related to the item
%     which continues on like this.
%   next item
%     blah blah blah
%
% So, now I do this:
%  \begin{description}
%    \hangitem{item label} text related to the item which continues
%      on like this.
%    \hangitem{next item} blah blah blah
%  \end{description}
% Instead of calling it a description, you can call it a hanglist
% so when we get LaTeX 2.09 (Real Soon Now :-) ) we can do this
% properly.  I had brought this up with Leslie Lamport and he
% suggested a way that almost worked, and then decided he could
% make a minor change to latex that would make this easy to do.
% The main problem with this is that each \hangitem must have
% text to go with it.  But if you have no text, then you can use just
% a normal \item.
\let\hanglist\description
\let\endhanglist\enddescription
%\def\hangitem#1{\@item[#1] \hfil\break}
\def\hangitem#1{\@item[{\parbox[b]{.8\textwidth}{#1}}] \hfil\break}
