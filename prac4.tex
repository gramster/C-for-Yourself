Practical Session 4

1)    Enter     vi     with     file     menu.c.     Write     a     function
do_menu(menu,response,valid_res), which takes as arguments menu (a pointer to
one of  the menu  functions),  response  (a  pointer  to  a  character),  and
valid_res (a string of characters representing valid responses). The function
should have  a local  variable buff,  a string of 80 characters. The function
should clear  the screen,  print the  menu, underline it, get a response (use
gets(buff);) for  this). *response  should be  set to  the first character in
buff (use toupper(c)), and CONT should be returned.

Change main  in main.c to test using this function to print the menus and get
a response.

2) The  C if  statement has  the basic form if (expression) statement. Change
do_menu so  that after  getting a response, if the first character in buff is
ASCII 0 it returns QUIT immediately (note: use == to test for equality in C).

3) Change  getvalue to  take three integer arguments, bottom, top and old. If
the value  entered lies  in the  range [bottom,top],  it should  be returned;
otherwise, old should be returned.
