# C for Yourself - A Book on C

Back in the 1990s I taught a number of courses at the University of Cape Town, and together with Prof. Riel Smit, wrote the in-house
textbook on C programming. These are the TeX sources for that book. I did not have a PDF copy, and only created on for the purposes of 
this repo (cbk.pdf); I was missing a number of style files so there are a few anomalies in formatting like an empty table of contents.
