# C for Yourself - A Textbook on C

Back in the late 1980s/early 1990s I taught a number of courses at the University of Cape Town, and together with Prof. Riel Smit, wrote the in-house
textbook on C programming (I wrote most of the content; Riel was more of a TeXpert than me and polished it up a lot).
These are the TeX sources for that book. I did not have a PDF copy, and only created one for the purposes of 
this repo (cbk.pdf); I was missing a number of style files (that Riel had but I didn't) so there are a few anomalies in formatting.

At the time of writing ANSI C was still an evolving proposed standard, so the book mostly uses Kernighan and Ritchie style syntax.
That may look a bit strange to a modern audience but is easy enough to grasp. Despite this text being very dated, I was quite proud
of it, and think Riel and I did a good job. If you are new to C, you may still find this is a useful introduction, with some caveats.
